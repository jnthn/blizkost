# This is not the Perl 5 bridge you're looking for

Blizkost was an early experiment exploring embedding Perl 5 in order to provide access to Perl 6 modules from
Perl 6. This effort has been replaced by [Inline::Perl5](https://github.com/niner/Inline-Perl5), which is
far more complete and works with the current Rakudo Perl 6 implementation.
